PROJECT TITLE:PENTOMINOES

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:The purpose of this project is to create an algorithm that can efficiently fit different (pentominoes) into a grid.
 The program takes user input for the size of the grid and the types of pentominoes to use, 
 then attempts to fit these pentominoes into the grid in a way that fills the grid completely without overlap.

VERSION or DATE: 1.0, 12/10/2023

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
-Please be sure that on you computer there is a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
-Import the project files, including PentominoBuilder.java, Search.java, BruteForceAlgorithm.java, UI.java, and PentominoDatabase.java and necessary .csv files.
-Run the Search class to start the program.
-Give input to the console following the on-screen prompts, specifying the dimensions of the grid and the desired pentominoes for the puzzle.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
- Start the application following the steps above.
- Interact with the console to set up your puzzle, providing the grid size and chosen pentominoes.
- Watch the algorithm in action as it solves the puzzle or returns feedback if the puzzle is unsolvable with the given parameters.
- Experiment with different grid sizes and pentomino combinations to explore various outcomes and the algorithm's adaptability.
